## 🎯 The Vision
Our goal is to bridge the "maintenance gap" for students living in shared accommodations. While we are starting with university dorms, the architecture of **Quick-Fix** is designed to scale for public use, allowing any property management company or hostel provider to manage their facilities efficiently.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Secure Access:** User authorization for personalized request tracking.
- **Categorized Inputs:** Specific reporting for **Electric**, **Plumbing**, and **Furniture** issues.
- **Real-Time Status:** Track requests through three stages: `Pending`, `In Progress`, and `Fixed`.
- **Request History:** A dedicated "My Requests" page to view all past records.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter & Dart
- **UI:** Material Design 3
- **State Management:** Provider / setState
- **Local Storage:** (Planned: Hive/Sqflite for persistence)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/quick_fix_app.git`
